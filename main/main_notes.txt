Changes in flask migrate process. 

1. I download all the latest dependencies including 
flask-migrate.

2. The video approach for migrating database is old and isn't supported 
by latest flask-migrate module. 

3. Recent process: use flask cli commands 

-> import Migrate from flask_migrate (latest library) and
and provide app & db to Migrate

from flask_migrate import Migrate
migrate = Migrate(app, db) 

-> go to 'backend' docker container 
docker-compose exec backend bash

-> set environment variable inside container
export FLASK_APP=main.py

-> Run following commands
flask db init
flask db migrate -m "Initial migration"
flask db upgrade


init: Initializes a new migration directory. This directory contains 
configuration files and a versions folder where future migration 
scripts will be stoerd. 

migrate: Generates a migration script based on the changes 
detected in your database models. This script outlines how to 
apply or reverse the changes in your database schema. 

upgrade: Applies the latest migration scripts to your 
database, updating its schema to match your models.
